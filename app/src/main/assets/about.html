<p>Subsidized housing is long-term housing for people who permanently reside in British Columbia. Rental fees are calculated on a rent geared to income basis (30% of household total gross income, subject to minimum rent based on # of people).</p>

<p><strong>You may be eligible</strong> for subsidized housing if you can live independently and meet the household, residency, income and assets criteria.&nbsp;</p>
